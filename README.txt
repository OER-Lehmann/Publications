The scripts are divided by the analysis they made.

1.	Calculation of PCoA, correlation between distance to centroid and percentage
	of missing data per taxon. Figs. 1-3.

2.  Analysis of simulating Beta-distributed missing data on the previous
    correlation, starting from complete matrices. Fig. 4.

3.  Analysis of the effect of homogeneously distributed missing data in selected
    matrices over disparity measures. Fig. 5.

4.  Analysis of the effect of heterogeneous distributions of missing data among
    groups of taxa. Fig. 6.

5.  Analysis comparing Ciampaglio et al. (2001) to the present work.
